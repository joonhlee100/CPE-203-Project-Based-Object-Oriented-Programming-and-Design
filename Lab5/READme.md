In Lab5, we were required to use comparators and lambdas in our programs that compared Song Titles, Artists, and Date in order to sort them. We also practiced with lambda expressions just to get practice with the functionality with it.
It was interesting how lambda expressions can be used to call a method and it was pretty cool seeing it sort two songs based on whatever attribute I wanted it to have. It's weird, but also something that can be useful for me in the future.
