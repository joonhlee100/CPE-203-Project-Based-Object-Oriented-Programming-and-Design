Lab00's objective was to introduce us with Java's syntax by translating a Python program to Java. It also required us to understand how to develop, compile on one of the school's Unix servers, and run a complete Java program.

This lab was fairly easy to do, since I took AP Computer Science senior year in high school, which was taught in Java, so it was a nice quick review.
